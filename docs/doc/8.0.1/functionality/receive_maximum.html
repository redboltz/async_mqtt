<p>Receive Maximum is a way to flow control PUBLISH (QoS1, QoS2) packets. They require storage for resending. So the node should prepare the memory packet size * Receive Maximum. The maximum value of the packet size can be defined using <a href="maximum_packet_size.html">Maximum Packet Size</a>. If the node sends over the Receive Maximum packets, then it is protocol error. The counterpart disconnects the connection with DISCONNECT packet with Reason Code 0x93 (Receive Maximum exceeded).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>async_mqtt</code> automatically respects the Receive Maximum, so users don&#8217;t need to worry about it. If a user calls <code>async_send()</code> with PUBLISH (QoS1 or QoS2) packets more than the received Receive Maximum times before the publish sequence finishes, async_mqtt internally queues the PUBLISH packets. When the receive count decreases, the queued PUBLISH packets are sent. The order of sending the PUBLISH packets is the same as the order of the user&#8217;s <code>async_send()</code> function calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no explicit limitation on the number of queued packets. However, in order to create PUBLISH (QoS1 or QoS2) packets, the user needs to acquire a Packet Identifier. This is limited to a maximum of 65535, so it also limits the number of queued packets.</p>
