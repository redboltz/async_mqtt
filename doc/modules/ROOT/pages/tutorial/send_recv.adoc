= Send/Recv packets

== cpp:async_mqtt::basic_endpoint::async_recv[async_recv()] funtion

You need to call the cpp:async_mqtt::basic_endpoint::async_recv[async_recv()] function when you want to receive MQTT packets. It is similar to Boost.Asio's `async_read()` function, allowing you to control packet receiving timing. `async_mqtt` does not use handler registering style APIs such as `set_publish_handler()`. If you need handler registering APIs, you can create them using `async_recv()`.

The `async_recv()` function is more flexible than handler registering APIs. Additionally, it works well with the link:https://www.boost.org/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/model/completion_tokens.html[Completion Token] model.

=== cpp:async_mqtt::packet_variant[packet_variant]

async_recv()'s CompletionToken parameters are error_code and cpp:async_mqtt::packet_variant[packet_variant].

If there is no error, you can access the `pv` using the `visit` function and overloaded lambda expressions. Each lambda expression corresponds to the actual packet type.

`packet_variant` is a variant type of all MQTT packets and `std::monostate`. `std::monostate` is only used if error_code is not `success`.

NOTE: `async_mqtt` has `basic_foobar` type and `foobar` type if the type contains MQTT's Packet Identifier. `basic_foobar` takes a `PacketIdBytes` parameter. `basic_foobar<2>` is the same as `foobar`. The MQTT spec defines the size of the Packet Identifier as 2. However, some clustering brokers use an expanded Packet Identifier for inter-broker communication. General users don't need to worry about `basic_foobar` types; simply use `foobar`.


You can access `packet_variant` as follows:

```cpp
namespace am = async_mqtt; // always use this namespace alias in this document
```

```cpp
// Let's say the completion token arguments are `error_code ec, packet_variant pv`.
if (ec) {
    std::cout
         << "MQTT CONNACK recv error:"
         << ec.message()
         << std::endl;
}
else {
    // `pv` can be converted to boolean. If `pv` contains a valid packet, it converts to `true`;
    // otherwise (`std::monostate`) , it converts to `false`.
    BOOST_ASSERT(pv); // if ec is not an error, then pv is always converted to true
    pv.visit(
        am::overload {
             [&](am::v3_1_1::connack_packet const& p) {
                 std::cout
                     << "MQTT CONNACK recv "
                     << "sp:" << p.session_present()
                     << std::endl;
             },
             // other packets handling code here
             [](auto const&) {}
        }
    );
}
```

=== Control Packet Type filter

You might be interested in specific packets. Your application may not need to handle non-important packets like PINGRESP, PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL, and PUBCOMP packets.

You can filter packets as follows:

```cpp
// ep is endpoint shared_ptr
ep->async_recv(am::filter::match, {am::control_packet_type::publish}, completion_token);
```

When you set `filter::match` as the first argument, the second parameter is a list of matching MQTT Control Packet types. If unmatched packets are received, the `completion_token` isn't invoked, but the received packets are appropriately processed. If an error occurs, the `completion_token` is invoked with a `ec` that contains the error.


```cpp
// ep is endpoint
ep->async_recv(am::filter::except, {am::control_packet_type::pingresp, am::control_packet_type::puback}, completion_token);
```

When you set `filter::except` as the first argument, the second parameter is a list of MQTT Control Packet types to ignore. If the packets in the list are received, the `completion_token` isn't invoked, but the received packets are appropriately processed. If an error occurs, the `completion_token` is invoked with a `packet_variant` that contains the error.

== cpp:async_mqtt::basic_endpoint::async_send[async_send()] function

MQTT has various packet types, such as CONNECT, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and so on. To send a packet, first create the packet and then pass it as a parameter to `async_send()`. If the send timing is a protocol error, the `async_send()` `CompletionToken` is invoked with a `system_error`.

You can call `async_send()` continuously. The `async_mqtt` endpoint has a queuing mechanism. When the previous `async_send()` function's `CompletionToken` is invoked, the next packet in the queue is sent, if it exists.

== Packet Based APIs

`async_mqtt` automatically updates the endpoint's internal state when sending and receiving packets. See xref:../functionality/packet_based.adoc[Packet Based APIs].
