= Header Files

== Add Include Path

Add the `async_mqtt/include` directory to your include path.

== Convenient Header

To enable all functionalities (except for specific underlying layers), include:

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/all.hpp>
```

== Underlying Layer Headers

=== For TCP on MQTT

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/asio_bind/predefined_layer/mqtt.hpp>
```

This header is included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.

=== For TLS on MQTT

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/asio_bind/predefined_layer/mqtts.hpp>
```

This header is **not** included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.

=== For WebSocket on MQTT

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/asio_bind/predefined_layer/ws.hpp>
```

This header is **not** included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.

=== For WebSocket/TLS on MQTT

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/asio_bind/predefined_layer/wss.hpp>
```

This header is **not** included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.

== Directory Structure

```cpp
async_mqtt/all.hpp     # Convenient header
          /asio_bind/  # Boost.Asio binding for endpoint/client
          /protocol/   # I/O-independent MQTT protocol state machine
          /separate/   # Headers for separate compilation
          /util/       # Common utilities
```

== I/O-Independent MQTT Protocol Machine

If you don't need Boost.Asio bindings, you can include:

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/protocol/connection.hpp>
```

This header is included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.

== Logging

To enable logging, include:

```cpp
#include <async_mqtt/util/log.hpp>
#include <async_mqtt/util/setup_log.hpp>
```

These headers are included in `async_mqtt/all.hpp`.
