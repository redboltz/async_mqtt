= Design Goal

== MQTT Conformance

async_mqtt fully supports all functionalities of MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0, allowing users to send and receive every type of MQTT packet. For features that require stateful connection management, async_mqtt provides robust support.

== I/O Independent (Sans-I/O)

async_mqtt offers a pure MQTT protocol library that is completely independent of any I/O implementation. It works with any I/O platform, including stub implementations.

== Asio Friendly

In addition to its pure MQTT protocol library, async_mqtt provides Boost.Asio I/O bindings, making it highly Asio-friendly. It supports Asio-style completion tokens—including the default tokens—allowing users to bind executors, cancellation slots, and allocators. Moreover, async_mqtt is compatible with coroutines and supports Asio-style multiple completion waiting.

== High Performance

async_mqtt is designed for high-performance communication. Recognizing that balancing latency and throughput can be a trade-off, it allows configuration on a per-`endpoint` and per-`client` basis. This flexibility makes async_mqtt suitable not only for MQTT clients but also for high-performance brokers. For further details, see the xref:performance.adoc[performance] page.

== Support for Various Underlying Layers

async_mqtt supports a wide range of underlying layers, including TCP, TLS, and WebSocket, as well as user-defined layers such as test stubs.

== Support for Both Detailed Low-Level Operations and Convenient High-Level Operations

async_mqtt caters to diverse development needs by supporting detailed low-level operations alongside convenient high-level APIs. Through the `endpoint` component, it allows granular control—such as sending any MQTT packet at any time—while the higher-level `client` component (built on top of the `endpoint`) provides a more streamlined interface for typical use cases.

== Support for Broker Cluster Development

async_mqtt is also well-suited for broker development. In broker cluster environments where inter-broker communication is critical, async_mqtt supports expanded-length packet identifiers to meet these requirements.
