== 2.0.0

=== breaking changes

==== endpoint
* Made endpoint non movable. #79.
** It is designed non copyable and non movable but the code was able to movable invalidly,
   so this is a bug fix. However some of test, broker, and bench code had been used move constructor.
   Hence I categolize the fix to breaking changes.
