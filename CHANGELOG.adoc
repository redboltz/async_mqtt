* Fixed private constructor chosen problem on publish packet. #325
* Refined tests. #322

== 8.0.1

== 8.0.0
=== breaking changes
* `client` becomes `shared_ptr` similar as `endpoint`. #315
** To create `client` instance, `client<...>::create(args)` similar as `endpoint`.
** This is required to keep client's lifetime during async operation is working.
** `client` and `endpoint` are consistent interface now.
=== other updates
* Move endpoint definition (using) to endpoint_fwd.hpp #311, #312
* install `*.ipp` files along with other header files #309
* Refined documents. #308

== 7.0.0
=== breaking changes
* client::async_recv() CompletionHandler signature is updated to `void(error_code, packet_variant)`. #281.
** `packet_variant` has one of `std::monostate`, `[v3_1_1|v5]::publish_packet`, `[v3_1_1|v5]::disconnect_packet`, or `v5::auth_packet`.
* Renamed the typename from `pubres_t`  to `pubres_type` for consistency. #280
* Re-designed error_code handling respect to Boost.Asio way. #266, #270, 271, #272, #273, #299
** All async functions has the Completion Handler signature as `void(async_mqtt::error_code, ...)`, except `void()`.
*** It works well with other Boost.Asio based libraries, and Boost.Asio itself.

** Some of async/sync function overload had been conflicted. e.g) acquire_unique_packet_id().
* Unified naming rule of types to `*_type`. #232
* Refined type of PacketIdentifier. Now `packet_id_type` is the type. #231
* Moved include/async_mqtt/broker/*.hpp to tool/include/broker/*.hpp #224
** Those are for broker allication that is used for system testing.
* Re-organized directory strucure respect to boost libraries. #211, #229, #230, #234
** It affects the users only if include the specific header file directly.
* Re-desined strand handling. #206
** template parameter Strand is removed. Users can pass strand wrapped executor for multi threading.
** associated properties of the completion handler are correctly propagated.
* Removed buffer from packet interface except the infterface for adcanced user. #195, #262
** For example, create PUBLISH packet using "topic1", and get the filed as string by `topic()`.
*** No `allocate_buffer("topic1")` is required.
* Organized predefined headers. #194
** For mqtt, include `async_mqtt/all.hpp`. In addition,
** For mqtts, include `async_mqtt/predefined_layer/mqtts.hpp`
** For ws, include `async_mqtt/predefined_layer/ws.hpp`

=== breaking changes

==== endpoint
* Made endpoint non movable. #79.
** It is designed non copyable and non movable but the code was able to movable invalidly,

   Hence I categolize the fix to breaking changes.
