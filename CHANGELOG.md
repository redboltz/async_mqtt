## 2.0.1
- Improved buffer implementation to support various compilers. #87

## 2.0.0
### breaking changes
#### endpoint
- Made endpoint non movable. #79.
  - It is designed non copyable and non movable but the code was able to movable invalidly,
    so this is a bug fix. However some of test, broker, and bench code had been used move constructor.
    Hence I categolize the fix to breaking changes.
